This repository is the home for my Media Workflow documentation, meant to describe the process by which media is requested and moved between a local and remote media server.

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to document the separate components which make up the whole media workflow. Since each component solves a specific problem, I think it makes sense for each to be housed in their own repository with this documentation repository providing a holistic view of the whole process.

This project is part of the broader [Infrastructure Documentation](https://github.com/chase-slept/infra-doc) project--please check it out if you're interested.

## Notes/To do

- Create write-up or README for media workflow
- Create/Tie in other repos/projects:
